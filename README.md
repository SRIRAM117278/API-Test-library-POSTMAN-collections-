# 📦 Postman API Test Library

A reusable **API testing project using Postman** that demonstrates automated validation of REST APIs using JavaScript-based test scripts.  
This repository is designed to showcase **API testing fundamentals**, **best practices**, and **real-time automation concepts**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project contains Postman collections built as an **API Test Library**, where common test cases are reused across multiple API requests.  
It validates API functionality by checking response status codes, response time, headers, and response body data.

The project also demonstrates **API chaining** by extracting dynamic values (such as tokens) and reusing them in subsequent requests using environment variables.
